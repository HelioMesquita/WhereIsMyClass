# Find Your Class
A simple Apple Watch app (study) that Eniac College students can find in their classroom

The api is a web crawler created in Ruby, using Nokogiri and Mechanize. The operation is to get the html then parsed and created the json used by the application.

To test:
  - Uses the id 236162015
  - Then wait 30 seconds to reboot heroku machine :)
